1. Numeric Mode
In numeric mode, permissions are represented by a three-digit number. The digits correspond to the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.

Read (r) = 4
Write (w) = 2
Execute (x) = 1

2. The permissions are added together for each category:

7 = read (4) + write (2) + execute (1)
6 = read (4) + write (2)
5 = read (4) + execute (1)
4 = read (4)
3 = write (2) + execute (1)
2 = write (2)
1 = execute (1)
0 = no permissions
