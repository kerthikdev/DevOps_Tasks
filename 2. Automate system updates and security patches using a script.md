Automate system updates and security patches using a script

# 1. why :
    1. Automating system updates and security patches ensures security, stability, and compliance by keeping software up to date. It prevents cyber threats, improves performance, and reduces manual effort. Regular updates fix vulnerabilities, preventing zero-day attacks. While automation is ideal for non-critical systems, production servers should follow a controlled update strategy. This approach ensures reliability without unexpected disruptions. ðŸš€


# 2. Code :
        
        ```

        #!/bin/bash
        #Log file to store update details
        LOG_FILE="/var/log/system_update.log
        # Update package lists to get the latest versions available
        echo "Updating package lists..." | tee -a $LOG_FILE
        sudo apt update >> $LOG_FILE 2>&1
      
       ````

        1. 2>&1 => 2> explility mention the file descriptor 
        2. > rewrite 
        3. >> append 
        4. &1 (file descriptor)
           1. 0 -> input 
           2. 1 -> output 
           3. 2 -> error 
        5. >{append}, 2>{expliccity append on 2 file descriptor } , 2>&1 {do what stdout is doing when stderror happens} , {and stdout and stderror to the same file }
